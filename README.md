# iOS_AutolayoutAndScrollView
In this project, using a “pure Auto Layout approach,” we programmatically create a UIScrollView with three subviews of UIView's. These three subviews, colored blue, yellow and green, will comprise the scrollable content area of our scroll view. The size and position of our scroll view will be animated into place by modifying its Auto Layout constraint values. The size of our scroll view (the view port) will be defined as a ratio of the width and height of the device's screen. The width of the scrollable area will be defined as one and a half times that of the scroll view's width. Our scroll view along with its subviews will dynamically resize to support both landscape and portrait view orientations, however, the ratio of the scrollable area to that of the scroll view's width will not change. The project accompanies our programming tutorial that can be found on our blog.agupieware.com.
